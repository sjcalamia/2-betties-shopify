      <h3>Natural vs. Refined Sugars.</h3>
      <p>Sugar, regardless of its source, is a simple carbohydrate converted into glucose that the body then uses for energy. There is a big difference, however, between natural sugar and added sugar, refined sugar, and non-refined sugar. Added sugar can be refined or non-refined. Unrefined natural sweeteners such as maple syrup and honey have more beneficial nutrients compared to refined sugars—including table sugar, high fructose corn syrup, beet, or rice syrups.</p>
      <p><strong>The American Heart Association suggests an added sugar limit per day for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Women 24 grams or about 6 teaspoons of sugar (100 calories) and,</li>
        <li>Men 36 grams or about 9 teaspoons of sugar (150 calories.)</li>

      <h3>Power up your protein knowledge.</h3>
      <p>Protein aids the healthy development of your organs, tissues, muscles, hair, and nails. Additionally, protein helps support the absorption of important nutrients use universally by the body to develop, grow, and function normally. This incredible enzyme and hormone producer is the building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood. It also helps to reduce hunger and boost metabolism—helping you to lose/maintain your weight while stabilizing your blood sugar levels. Protein is also known to help improve your ability to learn and concentrate—reducing brain fog and boosting your energy levels.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight or 0.36 grams per pound</li>
        <li>The average sedentary man should get 56 grams of protein; 46 grams of protein for the average sedentary woman</li>
        <li>1 Egg has 6 grams of protein, 2 Rounds have 6 grams of protein</li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Check the servings and calories&mdash;</strong>if you eat more than a single serving, you're multiplying the number of calories and percentage of the nutrient's Daily Value</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Make sure you're getting quality calories&mdash;</strong>check the label, read the ingredients and look at the calories. Are they really worth it? It all depends on the nutrients that come with it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Not all fats are created equal&mdash;</strong>Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are considered "good fats" and you'll find them in fish, nuts, and vegetable oil. Saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol all lead to potential heart disease and are a big NO NO.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Reduce your sodium, reduce your blood pressure&mdash;</strong>processed foods are big producers of sodium in yuour diet. For most people, 2,300 milligrams is current recommended limit and not necessarily recommended daily allowance. For health sake, consider lowering sodium/salt intake and increasing your amount of potassium to help counteract sodium's effect on blood pressure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Beware of sugar&mdash;</strong>and stay away from empty calories. Foods with added refined sugars and few essential nutrients should be consumed sparingly. If added sugar fis the first ingredient listed best to stay clear. Also look for these other added sugars: sucrose, glucose, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, beet syrup, rice syrup, maltose nad dextrose</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Note the first or second ingredients listed&mdash;</strong>these are the primary source of sustenance in the food and contribute to its overall nutritional value.</p>
